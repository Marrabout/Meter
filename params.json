With a custom, in-house method of analyzing the signal cell data, Meter uses four times as many data points and much more objective scaling to deliver high-quality, accurate results. Create your own Meter themes to match the rest of your interface, or use any of the three provided. Use Activator to swap between your theme, the raw RSSI string, and the default iOS 7 signal.\r\n\r\nAvailable for free from Github and BigBoss.
