=======================

An advanced, themable signal meter. Created by [insanj](https://twitter.com/insanj) (Developer) and [joe012594](https://twitter.com/joe012594) (Designer). Inspired by [the following concept / Vine](https://twitter.com/joe012594/status/487918030379184128).

Uses [Circlet](https://github.com/insanj/Circlet)'s precedent with status bar operations, and some of [libhbangcommon](https://github.com/hbang/libhbangcommon) for preferences pane work. License information for technology used is available in [ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md).
